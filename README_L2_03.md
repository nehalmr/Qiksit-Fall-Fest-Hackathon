## Overview
This notebook provides examples and exercises on quantum circuits using the Qiskit library. It may cover different quantum algorithms, gates, or circuits.

## Dependencies
The following libraries are required to run the notebook:
- **qiskit**: Core library for quantum computing in Python.
- **numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **matplotlib**: (Optional) For any visualizations.

Install the dependencies using:
```
!pip install qiskit numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. **Quantum Circuit Creation**:
   Various functions are provided to create quantum circuits, execute them, and visualize the results using Qiskit simulators.

2. **Example Usage**:
   You can modify and execute quantum circuits by adjusting the parameters and inputs within the notebook.

## How to Run
1. Install the necessary dependencies.
2. Run each cell to execute the quantum circuits and visualize the output.
